<h1 align="center">🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning</h1>
<p align="center">
A machine learning project that predicts Iris flower species using Logistic Regression.
</p>
<p>
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species using
machine learning. The classification is done based on flower measurements such
as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A Logistic Regression
model is used for training and prediction.

<tr>
<td><b>Working</b></td>
<td>
The Iris dataset is loaded from the sklearn library and split into training and
testing sets. A Logistic Regression model is trained using the training data and
then used to predict the species of flowers in the test data.

<tr>
<td><b>Prediction</b></td>
<td>
The trained model predicts the Iris flower species as
Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on the given input measurements.
